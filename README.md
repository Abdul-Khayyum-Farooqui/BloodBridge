# BloodBridge
Here are two clean, strong lines:  **BloodBridge eliminates life-threatening delays by connecting hospitals, blood banks, and eligible donors in real time to locate and secure compatible blood instantly.** **This unified network streamlines requests and responses, ensuring the right blood reaches the right patient when every second matters.**

## üö® Problem

Hospitals frequently face critical shortages of compatible blood during emergencies.  
The traditional workflow is slow and fragmented:

- Calls must be made manually to blood banks  
- Inventory information is often outdated  
- Donor networks are not activated quickly enough  

**The result: avoidable delays and preventable loss of life.**

According to the American Red Cross, thousands of lives are lost each year due to delays in accessing compatible blood during urgent situations.

## üèõ System Overview

BloodBridge is built as a **database-driven Flask web application** with two main layers:

### 1. **Core Schema (Identity Layer)**
Stores master data:
- Hospitals
- Blood banks
- Donors
- Location and contact details
- Blood type and eligibility profile

### 2. **Ops Schema (Operational Layer)**
Handles workflow and time-based events:
- Blood requests
- Fulfillment logs
- Status changes
- Notifications / escalations

A complete SQL export is included in the `db/` folder.
